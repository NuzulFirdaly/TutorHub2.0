This is the Mobiscroll example file linking to a trial build.

The Mobiscroll Trial comes with a number of limitations including:
 - Always connected mode. When using a trial build you'll always have to be connected to the internet.
 - Unoptimized packages. The trial packages are not optimized for size, load speed and content.

These limitations are lifted with the purchase of a license. You will be able to build custom download packages that can be included in online and offline apps as well.

Please refer to the EULA (from the license folder) or https://mobiscroll.com/EULA for more info.
